## Description

Save My Marriage! is a frontend project written using React and Redux Toolkit, powered by TypeScript. This project was conceived during a hackathon as part of Cohort 14's activities at [The Jump Digital School](https://www.thejump.tech). The primary objective of this app is to contribute to reducing the high divorce rate in the UK by providing reminders for important relationship milestones, such as your partner's birthday and your anniversary. By keeping these dates in mind, the aim is to strengthen relationships and prevent divorces. The project effectively combines technology with the pursuit of healthier relationships.

The app harnesses datetime functionality to accurately track and remind users of significant dates. It also incorporates calendar functionality to visualize upcoming events. The frontend is designed with the user in mind, using Tailwind CSS to achieve a fully functional and visually appealing layout. Screen modes and routes are used to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.
